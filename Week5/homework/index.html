    <p>Iteration 1: I started by drawing square and made them rotate to establish a repeating motion system.</p>
    <p>Iteration 2: Adjusted the rotation rate and spacing to make the movement feel smoother and less mechanical.</p>
    <img src="img/2.png" alt="Iteration 2" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;" />
    <p>Iteration 3: Expanded from two squares to a full set of layered squares, keeping the same centered composition.</p>
    <p>Iteration 4: Refined the size list and layer order so the visual rhythm became clearer and more structured.</p>
    <img src="img/3.png" alt="Iteration 3" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;" />
    <p>Iteration 5: After building the layered motion, I added a time-based delay so the color change only starts after a short interval(4 seconds).</p>
    <p>Iteration 6: I tuned the color shift intensity and timing so the color transition reads as a second movement rather than random noise.</p>
