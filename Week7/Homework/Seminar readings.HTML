    <h2>Programming Design Systems – Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Quote 1</h3>
    <h4>“Digital products allow users to interact with their content, and take advantage of motion and animation.”</h4>
    <p>
      This line reminds me that digital design is not only about layout or visual style. Unlike printed media, digital products exist over time and respond to user actions. 
      <br>These changes are part of the design itself. Because of this, a good digital design must include behavior, not just appearance. Motion and interaction help users understand 
      <br>what is happening and how the system reacts to them.
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 2</h3>
    <h4>“Code allows designers to create dynamic systems, not just static outcomes.”</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I like this quote because it clearly explains why code is important in digital design. Code helps designers build systems that can change based on input, time, or interaction.
      <br>I think by working with code, designers can think in terms of relationships and processes, which is essential for interactive and responsive experiences.
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 3</h3>
    <h4>“Throwing a design over the wall for production is a bad legacy of the printed page, and there is no reason for the design process to end with the birth of a product.”</h4>
    <p>
      I agree with this idea because I think design should be an ongoing process, not just a final handoff. Prototypes, code, and iteration are essential tools that allow designers
      <br>to continue learning from real use, we shouldn't treat production as the end of thinking.

    <h2>What Do Prototypes Prototype? (Houde &amp; Hill)</h2>

    <h3>Quote 1</h3>
    <h4>“Choosing the right kind of more focused prototype to build is an art in itself…”</h4>
    <p>
      This quote matches my experience. When I studied architecture, I used to think that prototype isn't very important, and that the final drawing or model mattered the most.
      <br>Prototypes often felt like unfinished or secondary work. After working more with interactive and digital projects, my view has changed. I now understand that a prototype 
      <br>can becomes powerful when it focuses on one clear question. Also, good prototype helps designers learn faster and make better decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 2</h3>
    <h4>“The goal… is to establish a model that describes any prototype… rather than the prototype’s incidental attributes.”</h4>
    <p>
      I read this as a warning against judging prototypes by how polished or finished they look. What matters more is what the prototype is trying to explore or learn, such as role, 
      <br>look-and-feel, or implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 3</h3>
    <h4>“Prototypes are a means of communication among designers, users, and other stakeholders.”</h4>
    <p>
      I like this quote because it shows that prototypes are not only for testing ideas, but also for communication. A prototype helps different people understand the same idea,
      <br>even if they have different backgrounds or expectations.
