    <h3>Quote 1</h3>
    <h4>“Digital products allow users to interact with their content, and take advantage of motion and animation.”</h4>
    <p>
      This line reminds me that digital design is not only about layout and visuals. Interaction and time-based change
      are part of the medium, so a “good design” must include behavior, not only appearance.
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 2</h3>
    <h4>“Digital products often have temporal logic… complex states and transitions.”</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I like the phrase “temporal logic” because it explains why static mockups feel incomplete. Many experiences are
      built from state changes (hover, press, loading, feedback), and we need prototypes that can express those shifts.

    <h3>Quote 3</h3>
    <h4>“Static design tools like Illustrator and Sketch fail at prototyping digital systems.”</h4>
    <p>
      This is a strong claim, but I understand the point: static tools can show a frame, but not the system.
      If the product is interactive, then prototyping needs to include rules, inputs, and responses, not only screens.

    <h2>Text 2: What Do Prototypes Prototype? (Houde &amp; Hill)</h2>

    <h3>Quote 1</h3>
    <h4>“Choosing the right kind of more focused prototype to build is an art in itself…”</h4>
    <p>
      This matches my experience because prototyping is mostly about focus. A prototype becomes powerful when it answers
      one clear question, instead of trying to simulate the entire final product.
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 2</h3>
    <h4>“The goal… is to establish a model that describes any prototype… rather than the prototype’s incidental attributes.”</h4>
    <p>
      I read this as a warning against judging prototypes by “how polished” they look. The important part is what the
      prototype is trying to learn: role, look-and-feel, or implementation, not the tool used or visual fidelity.
    </p>

    <h3>Quote 3</h3>
    <h4>“Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions.”</h4>
    <p>
      This frames prototypes as a thinking tool, not just a presentation artifact. If a prototype cannot help you test
      or evaluate a decision, it might be “finished-looking,” but it is not doing the real work of prototyping.
